    "review": "It has super strong aroma of coffee. In terms of face cleansing it do improve your face quality. You will notice difference immediately after using once or twice. I have been using the Bombay shavings charcoal kit from. Month. But now I believe both products are equally good. It all depends on your requirement. But after using coffee face wash once. I am addicted to its aroma and the purity it provides your face and neck with. But I also agree that charcoal face wash has a light aroma like you have get out of a shower. I like both of these types.",
